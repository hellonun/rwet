    "a woman who was a senior and was taking an electronic music class up at the Columbia Electronic Music Center, as it was still called then.  It was taught by a composer named Art Kreiger, and it was a very old-school class. I sat in on the classes with her, and our midterm assignment was to realize a two-part Bach invention using just a test oscillator and tape. So you would have to cut the tape up and splice it all together and realize that, okay, one inch is a quarter note. That sort of thing.\n",
    "My sophomore year I took a class called MIDI Music Production Techniques as a follow-up. I really hit it off with the instructor, who was a guy named Thanassis Rikakis, who had just finished his doctorate. It was my first exposure to using computers to make music, and I thought it was very interesting. The Columbia studios were still all analog except for this one, so I got in on the ground floor of the gradual transformation of Columbia's Electronic Music Center into the Computer Music Center it is today.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "computer on stage, which is very cool to watch. The best interactive performers are those who can deal with the patch responding in unexpected ways, and just keep going with it.  That's why natural improvisers make the best interactive musicians, in my opinion.\n",
    "I'm a big advocate of simplicity.  I never use score following based around specific pitch-based performance tracking; I think you're asking for trouble, expecially if you're like me and play in loud clubs and the nicest mic you'll ever drag onstage is an SM-57. I think trusting the computer to pay attention to an unpredictable data stream is a bad idea. I try to make it as transparent as possible for the user to interact with the computer, but also I don't want the computer making decisions that the user isn't completely informed about. When I have the robot turned on in my patches, all the lights that the user would normally be switching switch, and all the dials they would be turning turn, so you can see what's going on. The automatic processes aren't working on some hidden data file that you can't see.\n",
    "My patches for Elliott always have some huge ass number boxes hooked up to the pitch trackers, so he knows if something funny is going on and he can run with it. If I'd made it a black box experience and something started going wrong we'd be in deep shit.  While I really admire Max/FTS programmers who can sift through all the subpatches from the NeXT in the back of the room and see what's going on, it's just too complicated for the average performer to deal with. I think there's some truth to the saying that people can only pay attention to so much at once, that people have a limited bandwidth, especially in stressful situations like performance. The last thing anybody wants to happen at a gig is to have something schiz out on them and not know about it. That's why clarity of interface is so incredibly important.\n",
    "\n",
    "—that’s what foraging gives you. You understand what’s edible and you start seeing nature not just as a beautiful thing—as a picture-perfect thing to move in—but also as a very delicious resource. That’s a good thing. And I think that I have yet to meet anybody that starts foraging that doesn’t also feel they have a pact with it, which is also a great thing. Once you start actually indulging into it and really spending a lot of time in it you also want to take care of it much better. Basically you are obtaining a new skill set, a new knowledge, which connects you to the place that you’re in.\n",
    "\n",
    "it’s hard to talk about it without sounding like some New Age idiot, which I think is a bit unfair—but, if you do follow that natural cycle, you will inevitably eat better, cheaper, and much, much, much, much healthier. So culinary common sense boils down. Now that I have kids, I can even see that it makes even more sense.\n",
    "\n",
    "see if I could one day be able to smell a situation without prejudice. For example, sour milk was the first smell I attempted to train away because I had big problems with its odour. I have over 7,000 smells from reality in my archive and\n",
    "I went back to the same smells time and again because the first time you smell a smell is the essential moment.\n",
    "If it was emotionally negative or positive your relation to that smell will remain positive or negative forever unless you actively change that association. And today when\n",
    "I smell, I think of chemistry. I think, ‘How can I reproduce that smell?’ Smell has become a way of thinking.\n",
    "\n",
    "dimensions of smells. And because I have such a sensitive nose I smell combinations of smell which are incredible. The wind moves and what\n",
    "I smell is like a symphony of music. But there was one scent I engineered for Smell of World War I. Normally I look for the source, find the smell, copy and re-adapt its molecular components. But for World War I I didn’t have a source. I had references, narratives and descriptions from those who had lived through it, but even so it was very abstract. I didn’t know where\n",
    "I was heading. I just knew that I was trying to copy ‘something’; horse carcasses, mustard gas, earth, wounds, blood. I had to rely on extreme chemical components, and I built up a smellscape that was so disgusting that I ended up shocking myself and everyone else who smelled it.\n",
    "\n",
    "light inside people. when you close your eyes or dream, you see a different light than with your eyes open. we usually use light to illuminate the things around us. but I am interested in the very personal, inner light.\n",
    "\n",
    "sound is able to work with emotion more directly because you don’t have it connected to an involved source so much. Just as people made symphonies or devised instruments to make sounds, I’m interested in making the instruments and the things that produce light and can get directly to that.\n",
    "It’s a little bit like looking into the fire… You can kind of drift away in a faded state which is not not thinking, but it’s definitely not thinking in words. So if you want to work with that kind of trigger to emotive feeling, you have to work with it in that pure state, that’s why light was so powerful, it was something that we as a small children are attracted to. We have this very well known correspondence to light sources and looking at light. It’s very interesting because we’ve had recent evidence now suggesting that light knows when we’re looking, which is almost to imbue it with consciousness. But that’s anthropomorphizing, so that’s another subject.\n",
